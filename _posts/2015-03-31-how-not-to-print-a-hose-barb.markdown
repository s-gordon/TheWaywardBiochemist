I’ve been playing at supplementing our store of tools in the lab with
3D-printables. Most recently, a model of a [hose barb
adapter](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:158717) caught my eye. For the most
part, these are used for the attachment of tubes to side-arm flasks and the
like.

I’d decided to print multiple variations of the original model at once to get
an idea for the precision that my printer could offer. I used ABS, 20% infill,
and 0.15 mm layer thickness. Instead of blindly accepting the layout that
MakerBot offered, I made the choice to manually place each barb on the printing
platform, giving each piece a decent amount of space between printing rafts.

At first everything looked rosy...

...and then.

Due to the generous spacing between barbs each unit had an independent raft.
This made it fairly easy for the print head to knock one (or more!) of them
over. Of course the printer remained blissfully unaware of this mishap and kept
extruding plastic where it expected the barb to be, forming a horrible jumble
of plastic that wrecked the rest of the build.

For future reference – try and keep your 3D-printables closely bundled on the
build platform.
