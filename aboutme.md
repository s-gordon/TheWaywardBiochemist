# Me #

I’m Shane Gordon. I’m a Biochemist/Molecular Modeller, currently drumming away
at a PhD at La Trobe University, Melbourne.

You can find me on Twitter, [GitHub](http://github.com/s-gordon), and

# Digital Photography #

I shoot using a Canon EOS 1200D DSLR with either an EF-S 18-55 mm or EF 75-300
mm lens.

# 3D-printing #

I’m using a Flashforge Creator Dual Print Head 3D Printer for most of my
3D-printing needs, on temporary loan from a kindly colleague. A shameless clone
of the Makerbot Replicator, it looks a little flimsy to the eye but gets the
job done.

Depending on the purpose, most of my prints are done using either 0.15 or 0.3
mm layer slices in either ABS or (less commonly) PLA.
